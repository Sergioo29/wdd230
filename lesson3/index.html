    <h2 id="title">Sergio Silva's Chamber of Commerce website planner</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
    <p>As a student, we usually live in student apart complexes. Since the rent prices are subject to change at any time, most
        student find themselves moving from one partment to another pretty often. Moving that often may make more difficult to keep
        some belongings. Student may want to get rid of some items, but just giving it away does not seem too advantageous. Also,
        students studying business and other simillar fields may want to start right away, but the required resources and complexity
        of the proccess may drive them away. With that in mind, I created this chamber of commerce for Rexburg citizens, targeting
        BYUI students. In this website, any person or group will be able to search for items or services as well as post their own.
        The end goal to have a user-friendly, student drived website where anyone will feel confortable sharing their business ideas.
        The website will also provide a "recruiting" option, where the owner of the idea may request help from other fellow students.
