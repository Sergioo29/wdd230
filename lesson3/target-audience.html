<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The target audience will be the Rexburg citizens, BYUI students more specifically.</p>

<h5>The poor but smart student</h5>

    <p>John is the kind of guy that performs really well academically. He is studying business management, and he wants to apply
    what he is learning and get some money from it. He does not have money to pay for advertising nor sponsorship, yet
    he has some good ideas. One of his ideas is to help other students fill their Tax Return application. He is looking
    for a way to share that idea all around Rexburg. With Black Chamber, he could do that.

<h4>Jane Doe</h4>
<h5>The "hoarder"</h5>
<p> <b>Age: 30</b><br>
    <b>Income: $ 16,000 y</b><br>
    <b>Status: Engaged</b></p>

    <p>Jane was living with her parents untill recently. She got a lot of stuff from her parents's house into her new student apartment. She
    soon realizes her apartment is too small to keep all the things she brought with her. Her family lives in Washington, so 
    bringing it back seems pointless. Her parents already said that all that stuff is hers now.
    She is willing to get rid of some of her stuff, but not for free. She wants to sell, but she had to delete her Facebook and other social
    media due to ex-boyfriend stalkers. She can then use Black Chamber to do the selling without worring about social media.

<h3>Scenarios</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I have a service I want to sell and I want an easy and cheap way to do the marketing.</li>
    <li>I don't have Facebook or any other social media, so I can't use their free market services.</li>
    <li>Every e-commerce website I find asks for a paid subscription and I do not want to pay.</li>
    <li>A website where I can search for cheap student services such as beauty saloon, international foods and such here in 
        Rexburg will be nice because I know there are so many talented students here from all abroad that we don't even know about. </li>
    <li>My apartment could use some new furniture, but I don't have Facebook. It stinks to have to go to DI knowing
        that the stuff there is limited. Also, I will benefit more if I could search for the goodies available
        online, instead of going there to see what they have.
