<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The target audience will be Rexburg citizens, BYUI student more specifically.</p>
<br>

<h3>Personas</h3>

<h4>John Doe</h4>
<h5>The poor but smart student</h5>
<p>John is the kind of guy that performs really well academically. He is student Accounting, and he wants to apply
    what he is learning and get some money from it. He does not have money to pay for advertising nor sponsorship, yet
    he has some good ideas. One of his ideas is to help other students fill their Tax Return application. He is looking
    for a way to share that idea all around Rexburg. With Black Chamber, he could do that.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Mary Janee</h4>
<h5>The "collector"</h5>
<p>Mary just graduated from high school and got a lot of stuff from her parents's house into her new student apartment. She
    soon realizes her apartment is too small to keep all the things she brought with her. Her family lives in Washington, so 
    bringing it back seem pointless. Her parents already said that all that stuff is hers and that she can do whatever with it.
    She is willing to get rid of some of her stuff, but not for free. She wants to sell, but she is afraid of putting her info on
    Facebook or other selling sites. She can then use Black Chamber to anonimously sell her stuff, and can track her customers using
    the site.
